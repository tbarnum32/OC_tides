## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
library(VulnToolkit)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
OceanCity2024 <- noaa(begindate = 20240101, enddate = 20251030, 
  station = "8570283", interval = "6 minute")
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed). Import data from the NOAA website for Ocean City, MD in 2024.

```{r}
head(OceanCity2025)
dim(OceanCity2025)
class(OceanCity2025)
OceanCity2024 <- OceanCity2025
```

Initially named 2025, needs to be 2024. 2025 gave me an error about invalid time intervals, so I think the 2025 is incomplete - shows December data as 'preliminary' on the website. There are 87,840 rows of data and it is stored in a data frame, not a tibble.

```{r}
# Rename column heads for simplicity purposes
colnames(OceanCity2024) <- c("Date", "Meters", "Station")
ggplot(OceanCity2024, aes(x = Date, y = Meters))+
  geom_point()+
  theme_bw()
```
